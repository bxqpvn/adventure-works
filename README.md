# **AdventureWorks**

## Project Overview & Tools

### In this project, I will use SSMS 22 to connect to the AdventureWorks database. I will explore and analyze the tables, writing SQL queries to practice and demonstrate my SQL skills. After completing the SQL analysis, I also plan to build my first Power BI dashboard based on the insights gathered from the dataset.

### Tools:

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 22 – Querying and managing the AdventureWorks database

SQL Server Express – Local SQL environment for restoring and working with the database

AdventureWorks 2022 – Sample dataset used for analysis

Power BI Desktop – Building the dashboard based on SQL insights

>[!TIP]
>## Connecting to the AdventureWorks Database

I restored the AdventureWorks2022 sample database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) following the official [Microsoft installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=ssms):
