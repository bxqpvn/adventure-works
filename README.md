## Project Overview

### In this project, I will use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 22 to connect to the AdventureWorks database. I will explore and analyze the tables, writing SQL queries to practice and demonstrate my SQL skills. After completing the SQL analysis, I also plan to build my first Power BI dashboard based on the insights gathered from the dataset.
