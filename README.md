# AdventureWorks

## Project Overview

### In this project, I will use SSMS 22 to connect to the AdventureWorks database. I will explore and analyze the tables, writing SQL queries to practice and demonstrate my SQL skills. After completing the SQL analysis, I also plan to build my first Power BI dashboard based on the insights gathered from the dataset.

## Tools

### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 22 – Querying and managing the AdventureWorks database

### SQL Server Express – Local SQL environment for restoring and working with the database.

### AdventureWorks 2022 – Sample dataset used for analysis.

### Power BI Desktop – Building the dashboard based on SQL insights.

## Connecting to the AdventureWorks Database

I restored the AdventureWorks2022 sample database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) following the official [Microsoft installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=ssms).

Below are the screenshots showing each step:

- Locating the .bak file

- Moving the .bak file into the SQL Server backup folder
- Restoring the database from SSMS
